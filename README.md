# NXEngine-evo


This is a somewhat rewrite/refactored version of nxengine
It tends to be more portable and use cleaner code.

* [Differences](#differences-from-original-nxengine)
* [Building](#building)
* [Running](#running)

## Differences from original nxengine:

* Port to SDL2 ( thanks to https://github.com/PIlin/NXEngine-iOS )
* More resolutions and widescreen support up to FullHD (thanks to https://github.com/EXL/NXEngine )
* Fullscreen for any resolution
* Gamepad with force-feedback support.
* Mimiga mask ending pictures (re-drawn by me)
* Modern main menu
* Header-dependency hell cleaned up. No more autogenerated headers
* Cleaned up nx.h
* Lists/maps from haiku replaced with std::vector/map
* smalfont -> smallfont
* removed built-in data extractor
* removed replays, as they were buggy/not implemented anyway
