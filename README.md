NXEngine-evo
============

This is a somewhat rewrite/refactored version of nxengine
It tends to be more portable and use cleaner code.

What done:

* Header-dependency hell. No more autogenerated headers
* Cleaned up nx.h
* Lists/maps from haiku replaced with std::vector/map
* smalfont -> smallfont
* more resolutions
* removed built-in data extractor
* removed replays, as they were buggy/not implemented anyway

Look in TODO for upcoming features

May (and most definitely) contain bugs.
